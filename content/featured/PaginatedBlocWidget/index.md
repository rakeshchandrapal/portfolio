An open-source Flutter package published on pub.dev that simplifies implementing paginated lists with BLoC state management.

This package provides a clean, reusable solution for handling pagination in Flutter apps using the BLoC pattern. It abstracts away the complexity of managing loading states, error handling, and infinite scroll behavior, allowing developers to focus on their business logic.

Built with clean architecture principles and designed for easy integration into any Flutter project.
